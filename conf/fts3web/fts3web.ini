# Uncomment this is you want to overload

#[database]
#engine   = mysql

### Oracle alternative
### You will need cx_Oracle
### For a connection string like
### (DESCRIPTION = (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = oraclehost.domain)(PORT = 1234))
###  (LOAD_BALANCE = no) (FAILOVER=no) (CONNECT_DATA = (SERVER = DEDICATED)
###  (SERVICE_NAME = service_name)(FAILOVER_MODE=(TYPE = SELECT)(METHOD = BASIC)(RETRIES = 200)(DELAY = 15)))
### )
### The configuration would look like
# engine   = oracle
# name     = oraclehost.domain:1234/service_name
# user     = user
# password = pass
# host     = <leave empty>
# port     = <leave empty>

### MySQL
# engine   = mysql
# name     = fts3
# user     = user
# password = pass
# host     = localhost
# port     = <leave empty for default>
