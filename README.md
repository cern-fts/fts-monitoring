FTS Web Monitoring
==================

The FTS3 Web Monitoring allows peeking at the internal FTS3 state: active transfers, success rate, optimizer decisions...

It is *not* a tool for historical data, data aggregation, etc... For this sort of uses, better use the [FTS Dashboard](https://monit-grafana.cern.ch/dashboard/db/fts-transfers-30-days?orgId=20).
